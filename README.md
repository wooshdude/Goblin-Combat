Goblin Combat is an RPG game made for the popular instant-messaging platform, Discord. Conquer dungeons with friends, level up, earn loot, and customize yourself! 

## Setup
### Server ID
Goblin Combat has a very straight forward setup. It requires two things: a Discord server in which you are an admin, and a Discord Bot Key. You can set up a new Discord Bot on https://discord.com/developers/applications. 

Once you've made a new bot, reset the key and save it.

### Game Channel and Screen Updates ID
These are the channels were game updates will happen. Your Game Channel ID is the place where dungeons will spawn, and Screen Updates is where updated images will be set. This is simply a limitation of the program, but may be changed in a future update. For now, you will want to have this channel hidden to everyone and muted for yourself, trust me. To get the channel's ID, right click on it and select 'Copy ID' (You may need to enable developer options in Settings > Advanced)
